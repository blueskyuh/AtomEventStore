A server-less .NET Event Store based on the Atom syndication format.

## Highlights:

- No server required; only storage

## Credits

The idea that an Event Store can be modelled as a Linked List was originally put to my attention by [Yves Reynhout](http://seabites.wordpress.com) in his article [Your EventStream is a linked list](http://bit.ly/AqearV).
